# ðŸ“œ Trader++ License FAQ

## What license does Trader++ use?
Trader++ is released under the **Apache License 2.0**. It is permissive, production-safe, and grants both usage and patent rights.

## Can I use Trader++ for commercial or academic projects?
âœ… Yes. You're free to use, modify, fork, and integrate Trader++ in any project, commercial or non-commercial.

## Can I offer a SaaS product based on Trader++?
ðŸš§ Not without permission. While Apache 2.0 technically allows this, I kindly request that **you contact me first** if your SaaS offering is primarily based on Trader++. I'm working toward a commercial strategy and want to avoid fragmentation.

## Will Trader++ remain open-source?
Yes. The core engine will remain open-source under Apache 2.0. I may offer commercial add-ons or hosted services later.

## Will contributions be accepted?
Yes! If youâ€™re contributing, you agree that your code is licensed under Apache 2.0, and you grant any necessary patent rights (per the license).
