## ✨ Why Trader++? 

Trader++ isn’t just another backtesting tool. It’s a full-fledged quant trading engine built for:
- **True Portfolio Simulation:** Manage multiple assets, cash, and trades as real portfolios—not just isolated strategies.
- **Plug-and-Play Modularity:** Swap in new strategies, data sources, or risk guardrails with minimal code.
- **Event-Driven Realism:** Simulate trades, slippage, and portfolio changes in a way that mimics real markets.
- **Powerful Guardrails:** Risk management hooks that go beyond stop-losses—unregister assets, enforce capital limits, and more.
- **Transparent & Hackable:** Built for experimentation, learning, and research. Every core component is swappable and inspectable.

**How is it different from Backtrader, Zipline, or QuantConnect?**
- 🧩 **Cleaner separation of concerns:** Market data, strategies, execution, and portfolio logic are fully decoupled.
- 🛡️ **Advanced guardrails:** Custom risk modules, not just basic stop-losses.
- 💡 **Portfolio as a first-class citizen:** Track capital, trades, and metadata in one place.
- 🧪 **Designed for research:** Easy to debug, extend, and run controlled experiments.
- 🌱 **Open, modern, and Pythonic:** No black boxes, no vendor lock-in, and ready for your next big idea.

## 🧠 Objective

Empower quants and developers to:
- Cleanly separate market data, strategies, execution logic, and portfolio tracking
- Run realistic, event-driven backtests and simulations
- Plug-and-play both single-asset and multi-asset strategies

Built for robust experimentation and real-world readiness, with proper portfolio management and capital accounting.

## 🏗️ Project Structure & Architecture

- `contracts/` — Core contracts and abstract base classes (Portfolio, StrategyBase, Executor)
- `core/` — Core logic, execution engines, simulation loop
- `strategies/` — Example and user strategies (momentum, buy & hold, etc.)
- `data_ingestion/`, `data_cache/` — Data loaders, adapters, and caching for reproducible research
- `analytics/`, `ml_engine/` — Analytics, reporting, and ML integrations
- `dashboard/` — Streamlit/Dash dashboard for visualization
- `run_backtest.py` — CLI entry point to run backtests
- `main.py`, `run/` — Additional CLI tools and runners

---

## 🚦 Development Roadmap (Next Steps)

1. **Finalize Core Contracts**
   - Audit and refine `Portfolio`, `StrategyBase`, and `PortfolioExecutor` for strict modularity and safety (no future leaks).
2. **Strategy API**
   - Enforce and document the `generate_signals` interface. Add more example strategies.
3. **Backtesting Engine**
   - Expand test coverage and logging in `run_backtest.py` and `core/executors/backtest.py`.
4. **Data Layer**
   - Ensure robust, reproducible data ingestion and caching. Document data contracts.
5. **CLI & Developer Experience**
   - Improve CLI usability and add clear usage examples.
6. **Dashboard & Analytics**
   - Expand analytics and dashboard integration for portfolio and strategy reporting.
7. **Documentation**
   - Add docstrings, inline docs, and contribution guidelines for new modules and strategies.
