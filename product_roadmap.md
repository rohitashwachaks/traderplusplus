# Trader++ Technical Reference & Builder's Guide

---

## ✨ Vision

**Trader++** is a modular, open-source, Python-native trading infrastructure platform built to empower independent quant developers, technical traders, and advanced retail investors.

> "We’re not building a toy. We’re building programmable capital."
> 

The goal is to democratize high-quality trading infrastructure through a developer-first experience that rivals institutional tooling, while enabling end-to-end strategy development, backtesting, and (eventually) live execution.

---

## 🤖 Core Philosophy

- **Modular Architecture**: Strategies, market data, guardrails, portfolios, and executors are isolated, composable units.
- **Single Source of Truth**: Market data lives independently; all modules consume it as a read-only reference.
- **Explicit Execution**: Trading logic resides in the executor. The strategy only observes historical data (no future leaks).
- **Developer-First**: CLI-first workflows, clean Python APIs, and minimal cognitive load.
- **Open Source Foundation**: Infra is open, monetization layers are opt-in (e.g., dashboards, SaaS, copilot).

## 🔧 System Architecture

### 1. `Portfolio`

Encapsulates:

- Portfolio name, tickers, strategy, rebalance/reconstitution frequency
- Cash and asset positions
- Handles position updates and trade logging
- No access to market data or future prices

### 2. `StrategyBase`

Defines a contract:

```python
@generate_signals(market_data: MarketData, current_date: pd.Timestamp, lookback_window: int) -> Dict[str, int]

```

- Must return: { 'AAPL': 1, 'MSFT': -1, 'SPY': 0 }
- No future data access
- Stateless OR maintain internal state if needed (e.g., rolling beta)

### 3. `PortfolioExecutor`

- Owns market data, guardrails, and the portfolio
- Responsible for looping over dates, querying strategy for signals, computing allocations, executing trades, and updating equity
- Strict separation of concerns

### 4. `MarketData`

- Fully encapsulated cacheable, queryable data layer
- Exposes:

```python
.get_series(ticker) -> pd.DataFrame
.get_price(ticker, date) -> float
.get_history(ticker, date, window) -> pd.DataFrame

```

### 5. `Guardrails`

- Optional risk-control layer (e.g., trailing stop-loss)
- Can unregister tickers from being traded

### 6. `Analytics`

- Generates metrics like Sharpe, Alpha, Max Drawdown, CAGR
- Relies on equity curve and benchmark data

## 📊 Roadmap (MVP to Paid Product)

### **Phase 1: MVP Completion**

- [x]  Finalize CLI + backtest
- [x]  Add `benchmark` support
- [x]  Complete strategy abstraction
- [x]  Public release with docs

### **Phase 2: Portfolio Reconstitution + Screeners**

- [ ]  Add screener module: e.g., top 10 most volatile stocks past quarter
- [ ]  Portfolio class supports dynamic `update_tickers()`
- [ ]  Reconstitute every N days/months

### **Phase 3: Web + SaaS Layer**

- [ ]  User dashboard with saved strategies
- [ ]  Hosted execution + storage
- [ ]  Email reports + alerts
- [ ]  Payment integration (Stripe)

### **Phase 4: Community & Growth**

- [ ]  Templates library (community strategies)
- [ ]  Launch Discord / Slack
- [ ]  Weekly blog / GitHub issues digest
- [ ]  Run a Backtest Hackathon

## 💰 Business Model

| Tier | Features | Price |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Free | CLI, OSS engine, GitHub access | $0 |
| Starter | Web dashboard, CSV reports | $29/mo |
| Pro | Strategy copilot, alerting, team collab | $99/mo |
| Custom | Broker integration, white-label, API | $499+/mo |

---

## 🚩 Known Risks

- Small target audience (Python-fluent quants)
- Competing against incumbent internal stacks
- Hard to monetize unless value is clear
- Feature creep without product traction

---

## 🔍 Traction Goals (VC Backable Milestones)

- [ ]  100 GitHub stars, 20 forks
- [ ]  25+ weekly active users
- [ ]  5 paid users on $29 tier
- [ ]  1 killer "hello-world" CLI use case

---

## 💪 Design Constraints

- No portfolio object can access market data directly
- No strategy can see the future
- No executor should mutate state outside the portfolio
- All trades must go through `portfolio.execute_trade()` for accounting

---

## ✨ Example CLI

```bash
traderpp backtest --strategy momentum \
                 --tickers AAPL,MSFT \
                 --start 2022-01-01 \
                 --end 2022-12-31 \
                 --output ./logs

```

## 🌟 Summary

Trader++ isn’t just another trading framework. It is:

- An open dev platform for programmable capital
- A fast CLI for backtests that "just work"
- A set of powerful abstractions you can scale
- A wedge into quant SaaS for power users

If executed correctly, it becomes the **Vercel for quant trading**.
